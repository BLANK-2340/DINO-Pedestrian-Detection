# Pedestrian Detection using DINO Model

## 1. Understanding DINO Model

DINO (Detection Transformer) represents a significant advancement in object detection, particularly for complex scenarios like pedestrian detection. It builds upon the DETR architecture while incorporating deformable attention mechanisms and multi-scale feature processing.

Key features:
- Transformer-based architecture with deformable attention
- Multi-scale feature processing for better detection across object sizes
- Enhanced query selection and bipartite matching
- Improved convergence through iterative refinement
- Efficient handling of both sparse and dense object scenarios

The model utilizes ResNet-50 as its backbone and employs a 4-scale feature pyramid, making it particularly effective for detecting pedestrians at various scales and under different conditions.
